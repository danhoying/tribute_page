            Carl Sagan is perhaps the most
            well-known scientist of the 1970s-1980s. He is best known for his
            work in studying extraterrestrial intelligence and his television
            series "Cosmos: A Personal Voyage", which helped to bring the
            wonders of astronomy to the general public.

            He is also known for his imaginative quotes. Some of the more notable ones include:
          </h3>
          <blockquote>"The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us — there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries."
            <footer>Cosmos (1980)</footer>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>"If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe."
            <footer>Cosmos (1980)</footer>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>"Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar", every "supreme leader", every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there — on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam..."
            <footer>Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space (1994)</footer>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>"Science is much more than a body of knowledge. It is a way of thinking. This is central to its success. Science invites us to let the facts in, even when they don’t conform to our preconceptions. It counsels us to carry alternative hypotheses in our heads and see which ones best match the facts. It urges on us a fine balance between no-holds-barred openness to new ideas, however heretical, and the most rigorous skeptical scrutiny of everything — new ideas and established wisdom. We need wide appreciation of this kind of thinking. It works. It’s an essential tool for a democracy in an age of change. Our task is not just to train more scientists but also to deepen public understanding of science."
            <footer>"Why We Need To Understand Science" in The Skeptical Inquirer Vol. 14, Issue 3 (1990)</footer>

            Unfortunately, Dr. Sagan's life was cut tragically short when he passed away in 1996 due to pneumonia at the age of 62. His great achievements to mankind will never be forgotten.
